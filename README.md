# dotfiles
Various dotfiles I use to configure my env. A lot of them are heavily based (or outright copied) from people smarter than myself.

## TODO
* gather remaining stuff
** aliases
** vim config
** zsh config
** qt creator config
** custom fun/useful scripts I have laying around
* make a small script that will symlink all of this stuff back to my home
