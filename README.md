# dotfiles
Various dotfiles I use to configure my env. A lot of them are heavily based (or outright copied) from people smarter than myself.

## TODO
* gather remaining stuff
 * aliases
 * qt creator config
 * custom fun/useful scripts I have laying around
 * gitconfig
 * qt creator color schema
 * kate color schemas
* make a small script that will symlink all of this stuff back to my home
